# OnTheMap

On the Map is a project built to satisfy Udacity's iOS Nanodegree Lesson 3 [project](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421).
The app allows a user to download other user locations, and upload a location of their choice 
from a Parse Server run by Udacity. The location information is supplied to and from the server in a JSON format with the coordinates supplied by Apple's MapKit. 

The app is written in Swift and utilizes Grand Central Dispatch, JSON, NSURLSession as well as UIKit. 

##Installation

and the repository will be monitored.
